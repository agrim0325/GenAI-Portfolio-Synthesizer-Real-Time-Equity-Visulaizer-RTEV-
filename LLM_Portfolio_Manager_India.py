LLM Portfolio Manager - daily end-of-day US equity screener and paper ledger.

HOW IT RUNS
    GitHub Actions runs this once a day at 21:15 UTC (after the US close) and
    on manual dispatch. It also runs locally: `python LLM_Portfolio_Manager.py`.
    Configuration comes from environment variables, or a local .env file - see
    .env.example. There is no notebook and no Google Drive; output goes to
    StockScreener/ beside this file, or SCREENER_OUTPUT_DIR when set.

WHAT IT DOES EACH SESSION
    1. Reconciles the ledger against Alpaca - whatever actually executed wins.
    2. Replays open positions for stop / target / hold-period exits.
    3. Downloads 2 years of OHLCV for the universe (Alpaca first, yfinance
       fallback) - long enough for a real MA200 and 52-week high.
    4. Screens technically and rescues news catalysts in parallel.
    5. Pre-scores deterministically: technical 0-60 plus news 0-40.
    6. Sends the top 30 to the LLM for catalyst scoring, news intelligence and
       a three-round final decision.
    7. Queues at most one order, to fill at the next session's open.
    8. Writes HTML/CSV/JSON reports and notifies Discord and WhatsApp.

LLM PROVIDERS
    NVIDIA NIM is primary and OpenRouter is the backup. Both are free tiers with
    their own request limits, so each has its own rolling-window budget and a
    circuit breaker; traffic moves to the backup as soon as the primary is
    throttled rather than after exhausting retries. Either provider alone is
    enough to complete a run.

SAFETY MODEL
    Fail-closed. market_data, catalysts, news and final must all succeed and
    validate before any order is queued. Position sizing and risk caps live in
    screener_safety.plan_order, not in the prompt: the LLM proposes a size, that
    function decides. With SCREENER_LIVE_BROKER set, Alpaca is the source of
    truth for fills, share counts and cash.

DISCLAIMER
    A personal learning project. NOT financial advice. Past performance does not
    guarantee future results. Always do your own research.

# report: the headline alone carries action, quantity, symbol and price, and the
# supporting numbers sit in a three-across stat row underneath. Colours follow
# the usual trading conventions (green filled, red rejected/loss, amber partial).

PICK HISTORY (last 20 closed picks — includes RSI, confidence, VIX, QQQ trend so you can spot the failure pattern):
{chr(10).join(history_lines)}

YOUR JOB:
1. Find the pattern. What sectors, sources, RSI ranges, VIX regimes, or confidence levels are winning vs losing?
2. Propose changes for manual review based on the available evidence.
   — Win rate >65%: fine-tune only.
   — Win rate 50-65%: adjust 2-3 parameters.
   — Win rate <50%: make meaningful changes across multiple parameters.
   — Loss streak ≥3: something is structurally wrong. Overhaul aggressively.
3. Proposals must satisfy the configuration contract; they are never automatically applied:
    - RSI_MIN 10-45; RSI_MAX 55-90; ADX_MIN 5-30; BUY_THRESHOLD 70-88
    - WATCH_THRESHOLD 55-87 and at least one below BUY_THRESHOLD
    - ATR_STOP_MULT 1-4; ATR_TARGET_MULT 1.5-8 and at least 1.5 times ATR_STOP_MULT
    - max_positions integer 1-5; min_cash_floor 500-10000; hold_days integer 1-30
    - trail_atr_mult 1-4; both volume ratio aliases nonnegative and equal
   - Blacklist entire sectors that keep losing
   - Whitelist sectors that keep winning
   - Set require_congress=true if congress picks outperform
   - Set max_vix to go to cash when markets are too volatile (e.g. 25)
   - Restrict source_preference to TECHNICAL/NEWS/BOTH if one clearly outperforms
    - Raise BUY_THRESHOLD within 70-88 to be more selective when losing
   - Lower WATCH_THRESHOLD to 60 to see more ideas when confident
   - Set avoid_earnings_week=true if earnings plays keep failing
   - Set only_profitable=true if unprofitable companies are underperforming
    - Adjust min_adx_buy within 5-30 if weak-trend stocks keep losing
   - Set require_above_ma=false to catch early breakouts below MA (risky but sometimes right)
    - Adjust min_dollar_volume_m within 1-40 if liquidity is a concern
   - Change hold_days to 7 or 14 if 10-day results are inconsistent
   - Add additional_tickers (e.g. ["PLTR","ARM","RDDT"]) to expand the universe
   - Raise sector_conc_max if diversification is hurting returns, lower it to force diversity
   - Lower rsi_exit (e.g. 75) to take profits earlier; raise it (e.g. 82) to let winners run further
   - Lower rsi_exit_min_profit / macd_exit_min_profit if momentum reversals are costing unrealised gains
4. If no clear pattern visible yet: keep current config unchanged.
